# Lecture 16 - Digital Logic Gates

The process is simple the logic gates takes an input and generates an output in both binary format

## Primitive Functions (less input)
And 
OR
NOT -> Invertor

Bit equality 

And base on the And, OR, NOT then we can have NAND, NOR, which is an invertor plus an primitive   function
And these will be in the circuit designing graph and it is import to understand what they are and what output they generate

## Primitive Function (more input )

usnig same logic and use it on the gates with more input
And the bit adder performs the addtion of the bit with resolution to overflow with carry in and carry out


## Combinational Circuits

These are for single one circuit so we need to make them connect together and act together to give more complex structure

Meaning generates from input of mutiple to one  oupput with CL symbol combining of the factor of upper bound and lower bound of delay

it classifies as CL with rules each gets passed only once with more input but only on output 
And CL can be compostion of output


## Boolean Algebra
